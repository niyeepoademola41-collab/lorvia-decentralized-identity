# Lorvia Decentralized Identity

Open-source decentralized freelancer identity and reputation layer built for the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling portable profiles, transparent reputation, and community-driven verification.

---

## Overview

Lorvia Decentralized Identity provides a Web3-native identity and reputation system for freelancers.  
It allows independent professionals to own, manage, and port their professional identity across platforms without being locked into centralized marketplaces.

---

## Problem

Today, freelancer identity and reputation are controlled by centralized platforms:

- Profiles and reviews are platform-locked
- Reputation cannot be transferred across ecosystems
- Visibility algorithms are opaque
- Accounts can be restricted without transparency

This limits freelancer autonomy and long-term career growth.

---

## Solution

Lorvia introduces a decentralized identity and reputation layer that enables:

- Wallet-based freelancer identities
- Portable, platform-independent reputation
- Community-driven verification and endorsements
- Open integration with marketplaces and tools

The system is designed as open infrastructure rather than a closed product.

---

## Why Web3

Web3 is essential to this project because it enables:

- On-chain identity ownership
- Transparent and tamper-resistant reputation logic
- Decentralized governance and validation
- Interoperability across platforms

These guarantees are not possible with centralized systems.

---

## Technical Approach

The initial implementation includes:

- Polkadot-compatible wallet-based identity
- On-chain freelancer profile storage
- Reputation scoring logic
- Community verification mechanisms
- Open APIs for third-party integration

The project is built using Substrate and aligned with the Polkadot ecosystem.
